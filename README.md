## Introduction

 The application will "duel" two of the provided items where the user selects winner. This is repeated until every item was in at least two duels.

At the end the winner and the complete results are provided.

The picker can also be shared at any point of the user journey.

This can be useful if one wants to know what the favourite of another person would be.
For that add your options click the start button and share the URL with the other person.
